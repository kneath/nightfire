# Nightfire

This was the first webapp I ever built (2001). It was an massively multiplayer hourly turn-based text game similar to [Utopia](http://utopia-game.com/shared/) and [Dominion](http://www.kamikazegames.com/dominion/).

Built on ASP 3.0 and backed by an Access database, one wonders why it wasn't the biggest success in gaming history. I put it here for posterity.
