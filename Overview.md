# Overview

The great ones are said to have created it.  It was the landmark of their civilization, a
great masterpiece indeed.  And yet, with all of its wonderous powers, it was that which
brought the end to the great one’s civilization.  

Only legends and stories of the great ones exsist.  It is said that they exsisted before anything else, early onn in the universe when only bare plantes and forever burning stars shone in the emptiness of the night.  Their civilization flourished in this newborn universe, allowing much potential for expansion and colinization.  As their technology advanced and the race evolved, the great ones began to wonder.  They began to wonder if they were alone in this universe.  This single question brought on milenia of exploration throughout the universe searching for some other life.  This search was futel and nothing was ever found but the occasional irrodecent rock that brough magical healing powers.  The great ones were suddenly faced with the prospect that they were alone in this universe, alone and afraid.  

Hope in the great ones began to deterriorate.  They felt that their civilization had reached it’s epoch and would never go farther, they started becoming very restless and hopeless.  They had explained nearly every question.  Except the one, the biggest question ever, the secret of life.

This question brought forth massive study projects that bound the civilization together.  If they could answer this fatefull question, they might not be alone, and this brought great hope to the great ones.  The leading project, funded by the gret one’s government was code named NightFire.  It was to symbolize bringing light into this empty universe.  Numerous planets were accidently destoyed in the process of researching.  Scientists were experimenting with profound amounts of energy trying to
recreate the beggining of life.

The research was accellerated when the discovery of a new resource was found. They called it Element-X, and it had very unique properties.  Many scientists experimented combining this compound with many things and when experiments with antimatter and Element-X were preformed, a breakthrough occourred.  Scientists had created it, they had created life.  

Great joy spread throughout the great one’s empire and the race was once again united in celebration.  They watched this new life evolve over time on an isolated planet while the NightFire project continued to make progress.  After many millions of years, the life that was created grew into an intellegent life form.  The great ones were able to watch this evolution take place, and they named this new race the larxons.  The larxons were the only race still exsisting to know the great ones, for they are the ones whom destoryed them.

The larxons developed a very advanced military and the great ones did not realize that these new life-forms might actually not want peace.  The larxons swept through galaxy after galaxy destorying the peacefull great ones.  Before the last of the great ones were exterminated, the NightFire project was able to give life to their ultimate creation named after the project.

NightFire is an object, or entity it is said.  It has the power to create life, and does so on a regular basis.  It gave birth to many new forms of life and populated the universe. It was truly a monument of the great one’s civilization.  The larxons attempted to contain this object, however all attempts were unsuccessfull.

The NightFire is out there and has the power of life, no one truly knows how it works but if it’s power falls in the wrong hands, life in the universe might cease to exsist.
