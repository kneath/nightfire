# Other Factors

Military Morale will not be a 0%-100% factor like in Dominion. Instead, will be between &#150;20% to +20% military effectiveness. Every 5% an attackerâ€™s target is larger/smaller will result in + or - 1% military strength. Military strength will return to 0% bonus at the rate of 1% per hour. Failed attacks will result in half the morale change and can never add to morale.
