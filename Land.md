# Land

There are two types of land in NightFire; Plain Land, and Destroyed Land.  Nothing can be built on Destroyed Land, it is only the wastelands left after a battle.  During a battle, a certain percentage of the land you conquered turns into Destroyed land.  In time, Destroyed Land becomes Plain land and you are able to build on it once again.
