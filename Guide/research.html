Here&#146;s how it will work: Each project will increase it&#146;s area by 5% standard. Projects will be large, time taking, and expensive. Multiple research projects in one area will be called &quot;Levels&quot; where level 0 is no technology existing and level 1 is 0% bonus. So &quot;level 3 atomic power&quot; will be +10% atomic power production. The number of levels one nation can have on different areas will be race dependent. Also, the available research projects types will depend on race. For example, ONLY the top tech race will have access to antimatter technology. Note that not all research projects will be for a percentage bonus. For example, races that do not start with atomic power will have to research to level 1 atomic power first. That is called INITIATION RESEARCH. Initiation research will be much more expensive than expansion research. I have a HUGE list of possible research projects&#133;I&#146;ll list the more prominent ones here. Note that not all research projects are scientific, some are magical!<br>			<br>				-Atomic power<br>				-Antimatter Collision (power source)<br>				-Antimatter Weaponry<br>				-Atomic Weaponry<br>				-Solar Power<br>				-Warring Energy Conservation<br>				-Construction (decrease building costs and time) <br>			-Training (increase infantry class unit power)<br>				-Military Technology (Increase tech unit power)<br>				-Medicine (decrease soldier casualties)<br>				-Shielding (decrease military tech casualties)<br>				-Stealth (increase scanner probe and covert agent strength)<br>				-Temple (increase magic strength)<br>				-Civilian Investment (no levels, works like alchemy science. Invests in enhancing civilian society and thus, higher income)<br>		</div>	</body></html>
