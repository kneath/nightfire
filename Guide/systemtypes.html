		<div align="left">
			<span class = "normal">Generic Star Systems</span> - The 10 planets revolve around a regular star. The star produces normal amounts of solar energy.<br>
			<br>
			- No advantage, no disadvantage.<br>
			<br>
			<span class = "normal">Black Hole Systems</span> - The 10 planets revolve around a black hole. The black hole itself produces some radiation energy, which can be harvested with solar energy technologies, but will not be as plentiful of an energy source as the sun. Also, the black holes intense gravity will distort the shape of the planet, causing faults that can result in damaged buildings. The plus side is that all invasions against a black hole system will suffer from a small attack strength penalty and a medium casualty penalty.<br>
			<br>
			- Low solar energy, occasional loss of buildings. Defense bonus.<br>
			<br>
			<span class = "normal">Red Giant Systems</span> - A red giant is a star right before its death. Red giants emit enormous amounts of solar energy but due to the intense heat, population growth will be lower.<br>
			<br>
			- High solar energy, slower population growth.<br>
			<br>
			<span class = "normal">Brown Dwarf Systems</span> - A star not large enough to go red giant, then supernova, then black hole will end in becoming a brown dwarf, and eventually a white dwarf. Brown dwarfs produce minimal amounts of solar energy, but surrounding settlements have the unique advantage of harvesting element-x from the cooler areas of the star.<br>
			<br>
			- Element-X bonus, very low solar energy.<br>
