# Covert Ops & Magic

Like espionage in Dominion, Covert Ops is used for the underground operations. There are two covert units, the scanner probe and the secret agent. Scanner probes are used for basic spying and information gathering operations while secret agents are used for more advanced operations like technology stealing, assassinations, civilian terrorism, etc. I dislike Utopia and Dominion’s fail and success modules though. Instead, I’d make ops work this way:

* not determined yet


## Magic

Very self explanatory. Note that mages will both produce mana and cast spells. Again, success rates and damage power will work this way:<

* not determined yet


## Operations

* **Factory Spy:** Scanner probes return with the amount of military tech units at home and in production.

* **Barrack Spy:** Scanner probes returns with amount of soldiers at home and in training.

* **Civilian Terrorism:** Agents plant bombs destroying city areas and killing civilians.

* **Spy on Research:** Since spying on a nation’s research status requires digging trough files and bribing traitorous citizens, agents will be required to carry this out. Will return the projects in progress and projects already completed.
 
* **Steal Technology:** A very difficult task. By infiltrating enemy research facilities, agents return with information that will aid your current or future research projects. (basically, stolen technology will push you a few steps closer to completion on current project or give you a head start on the next project).

* **Destroy Factories/Barracks:** An extremely difficult task since the agents will infiltrate a military structure. But loss of factories/barracks will slow down or hamper enemy military growth.

* **Hack Civilian Security:** Each nation has a civilian security, which is basically the FBI. By hampering with the records of civilians, it will cause major disruptions to the civilian society. Income will be hampered until the confusion has been resolved.

* **Nuke Detection:** Since atomic weapons emit radiation, detection of an atomic weapon is a rather easy task for the scanner probe.

* **Set off Nuke:** Since nukes are extremely well guarded (also depends on how much the target paid for guards), only the best agents can complete this task—but completion will result in a free nuking against your enemy—not bad right? Hehe. Your target does have to have a nuke first of course.

* **Drain Energy:** Agents sneak into energy plants and insert special sabotage tools to cause energy leakage, resulting in loss of energy of the opposing nation.


## Spells

* **Vision Channeling:** Mages can see the amount of enemy military units at home and at war.

* **Vision of Intelligence:** By looking into enemy researchers minds, mages can see what level of research a nation is at.

* **Foresight:** Mages foresee the outcome of a battle before it actually ends.

* **Aeolus’ Hate:** Violent weather will erupt on enemy lands causing great damage to buildings and civilians.

* **Ares’ Guidance:** Caster of this spell will gain a military strength bonus for a period of time. Morale will immediately jump to 100% and stay that way as long as the spell is in effect.

* **Dream of Morpheus:** Enemy units experience extreme fear, causing major loss of morale (can over come Ares’ Guidance).

* **Mors’ Touch:** Will swiftly kill civilians and draftees.

* **Hephaestus’ Shine:** Will produce massive amount of energy each time the spell is cast. High mana cost.

* **Call to Hermes:** Boasts income greatly and keeps income will always be at 100% (except for the effects of disasters)

* **Wrath of Nemesis:** Caster of this spell will get a very high offense bonus against anyone who attacked the caster within the last 12 hours.
